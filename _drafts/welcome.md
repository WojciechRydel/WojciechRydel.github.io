## Why I am starting this blog?
![Tailor]({{ "assets/launch.jpg" | absolute_url }})

I am a professional software engineer, thus coding is my job, but among this,
software is also one of my major hobbies and I try to be better each day.

One has said:
    <cite> Creating software is easy, but doing it right is very hard. </cite>

Making something working using software is very easy. You just have to learn
some basic concepts, pick some language and you can create e.g. simple web server. You can even create large systems after few years of experience and practice! Oh boi! You can even create systems for many, many years and still do not know how to make it right.

*What are those things which I should know?*- you might ask.
For start you should consider some basic questions, such as:

- What about other developers - how to write code so others can easily contribute to our work?
- What about changes which might be in the future - how write software, so additional feature would not require half a year to implement?

Of course there are many other factors regarding clean, efficient and
maintainable code.

Here I am going to share those conepts, patterns and practices. Although this is
main motivation of this blog, there also will be other software related stuffs.

Thus stay tuned!
