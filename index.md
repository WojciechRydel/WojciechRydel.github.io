Hi! I am professional full stack software engineer. I am focused on high
quality, efficent and clean code. I strongly belive that good software architecture
, design, patterns and proven practicies can resolve many major issues in
software development. That's why, every day I strive to learn about history of
development, proven architecture and desing patterns, to
[_stand on the shoulders of giants_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants) and to not repeat common mistakes.
